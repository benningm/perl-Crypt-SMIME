NAME
    Crypt::SMIME - S/MIME message signing, verification, encryption
                   and decryption

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a class for handling S/MIME messages. It can
    sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt messages. It requires libcrypto
    (http://www.openssl.org).

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    HINTS FOR WINDOWS USERS
        Openssl has to be installed first - and openssl/bin must be in
        PATH for the module tests.

        * The ENV for LIBCRYPTO_CFLAGS should point to the openssl
          include folder.
        * The ENV for LIBCRYPTO_LIBS should point to the
          openssl libraries.

        Example:

            set PATH=C:\openssl\bin;%PATH%
            set LIBCRYPTO_CFLAGS=-IC:/openssl/include
            set LIBCRYPTO_LIBS="c:/openssl/lib/libeay32.lib" "c:/openssl/lib/ssleay32.lib"

        Strawberry perl always provides a full *nix compatible
        libcrypro environment. There are no settings or additionally
        installations required for this perl distribution.
